# Sieve of Eratosthenes

A web visualization of an ancient Greek way to find all the prime numbers less than a given number

## Getting Started

This program uses html, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. You should not need to install anything except the program itself to see it work.

## Running

Install the program and then open it in your favorite web browser. It will ask you for the maximum number you would like to see in your seive (100 is the traditional number used; feel free to pick whatever number you like although too large of a number will time out your browser). 

To see the sieve in action, just start clicking on numbers! The page will notify you once all the non-primes have been eliminated.
